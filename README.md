# Doubly-Linked-List

This project is one of my CSCE 221 hw assignments. Our task was to create a simplified version of a router, using the data strucutre of a queue. The network packet simulates an internet protocol packet and the queue simulates the way in which network traffic uses first-come first-serve behavior.

Concepts:
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Queues
- Templating
- Rule of three
- Dynamic memory
